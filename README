Dr. Robert Geist
Due 3 March 2015

Features:

Required:
	-Vertex Buffers
	-Phong Shading
	-Normalized Blinn-Phong Shader
	-Anti Aliasing
		-AA method deviated slightly from the method we used in class, but smooths the edges just as well
Extra:
	Primitive scene rotation -
		a, d rotate the MV matrix about the Y axis
		w, s rotate the MV matrix about the X axis
		r, f rotate the MV matrix about the Z axis


Compiling and Running:

>g++ -g -Wall caweeks_bunny.cpp -o run -lm -lglut -lGL -lGLU -lGLEW
>./run bunny.obj


Comments:
When I see a bunny model like this, I think of chocolate Easter bunnies, so I decided to try to make it look like chocolate.  I
jumped around between different shininess values for the material before settling on the one I have now.  As much as I feel tempted
to use wildly different colored lights and materials, I think plain white lights work best here.  The rim light is slightly yellow, but
the key and fills are still white.

The file is .cpp even though the code is entirely C.  I wasn't sure if I wanted to use vectors when reading in the file, and the inclusion
of the GLEW library fixed a few warnings gcc was throwing.  I decided not to use vectors because I feel like they would be slower than
passing the file twice and counting the number of vertices / faces before reading them in.  I didn't test it, though, so I'm probably wrong.
I messed around with the shader as well and made a toon shader that colored fragments based on the angle between the view vector and its 
reflected vector.  It was too silly to include.
